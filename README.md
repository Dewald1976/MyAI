# JobMatcher

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

JobMatcher is an AI-powered platform that intelligently matches job seekers with the most suitable job opportunities based on their skills, personality, and preferences. It streamlines recruitment while helping candidates find their best fit faster.

## Background

The traditional recruitment process is often inefficient and biased. Job seekers struggle to find roles that align with their strengths, while employers are overwhelmed with irrelevant applications. This leads to missed opportunities, poor hires, and high turnover.

My motivation stems from seeing talented individuals overlooked due to keyword-based filtering or lack of industry connections. This project addresses a globally common problem and aims to bring fairness, efficiency, and accuracy into the hiring process.

* Problem 1: Skills mismatch in job applications
* Problem 2: Bias and inefficiencies in traditional recruitment
* Problem 3: Poor candidate experience and lack of feedback

## How is it used?

Job seekers fill out a profile with their education, work experience, skills, preferred work culture, and complete a short cognitive or personality assessment. Recruiters upload job listings with role descriptions, required skills, and team culture info.

JobMatcherâ€™s AI engine compares candidates with open roles, ranks best matches, and explains why a match is strong. It offers feedback to candidates and helps recruiters shortlist candidates more objectively.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data sources:
* User-submitted profile data
* Job listing databases (e.g. LinkedIn, Indeed APIs)
* Optional psychometric assessments (e.g. Big Five traits)

AI methods:
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) for parsing resumes and job ads
* Classification algorithms to rank fit
* Recommendation systems for job suggestions
* Fairness-aware ML to mitigate bias

## Challenges

JobMatcher does not solve:
* Hiring biases entirely (though it reduces them)
* Real-time validation of candidate credentials
* Cultural nuances in global job markets

Ethical considerations:
* Data privacy and user consent
* Bias in historical recruitment data

## What next?

To grow the project:
* Partner with job boards and HR tech platforms
* Expand personality testing capabilities
* Launch employer dashboards and feedback loops
* Integrate with applicant tracking systems (ATS)

Needed:
* Access to job and resume datasets
* Frontend development support
* Legal guidance on recruitment regulations and data handling
